Playing around with associating tags ("facets") with things 
("assets"), with a simple query language to search for assets 
that have particular tags.

ca.hullabaloo.facets.FExprParser implements a simple grammer 
(not particularly robustly), so you can search like 
"(facetA:val1 || facetB:val2) && !facetB:val5"

We run the same FExpr over three types of asset->facet storage

 * src.ca.hullabaloo.facets.MultimapAssetFacets
    Uses a SetMultimap from guava-libraries to store the associations,
    and the query basically does union/intersect on the resulting sets

 * src.ca.hullabaloo.facets.BitSetAssetFacets
    Uses a Map of Facet to java.util.Bitset, with one bit set for
    each asset assigned the facet.  The query basically does bitwise
    ands and ors over the BitSet

 * src.ca.hullabaloo.facets.CompressedAssetFacets
    Similar to the previous, except this Uses a map based on a 
    patricia trie, with the idea that keys like facet:foo and 
    facet:bar will take less space in memory (at a computational 
    cost).  Also, the bitset is an RLE-compressed bitset which 
    does not require decompression to execut bitwise and and or
    against other compressed bitsets.  Queries operate exactly
    as BitSetAssetFacets


As always, start with classes ending in '*Test'
